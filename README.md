## About this fork

This is a fork of the Diablo 2 rune wizard.  This fork contains an extension to the application to automatically select the runes from your character file.
Simply drag and drop the .d2s character file into the orange box into the top of the page to automatically select the runes that your character has in their possession.

## Background

_Runewizard_ used to be part of my mini fan site for Diablo II LoD called [_The Tankazon Resource_](https://fabd.github.io/diablo2/) (hosted at [fabd/diablo2](https://github.com/fabd/diablo2)).

This repo is a full rewrite of the vanilla JS version I wrote ten+ years ago. It uses **ViteJs, Vue3, and TailwindCSS/JIT**. Typechecking is provided via JSDoc + TS types in ambient .d.ts files.

Should there be any new runewords / updates with _Diablo II Resurrected_, I hope this new repo will make it easier to keep the site updated!

## Changelog

See **[Releases](https://github.com/fabd/diablo2-runewizard/releases)** tab for updates.

## Bugs & Feature Requests

Please report **any bugs or incorrect information** in the **[Issues](https://github.com/fabd/diablo2-runewizard/issues)** tab.

Feel free to post suggestions as well. If I like an idea, maybe I'll work on it.

## Contributions

In general **Pull Requests** for small fixes/typos are welcome.

For substantial changes, it's probably best to let me know in advance so I can tell you if I am interested to merge them. Keep in mind this is a little playground for me to experiment with ViteJs, Vue 3 and TypeScript (and now JSDoc). There are quite a few ideas I have in mind I'd like to work on.

## For D2 modders

If you need help to modify Runewizard for a Diablo II mod (ie. supporting new runes/runewords specific to a mod), feel free to ask in the Issues tab and I'll try to help you set it up. Let me know about your fork! I may post a link here and/or in the Runewizard footer.

# Getting started

## Local development

Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and start the Vite server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabd/diablo2-runewizard.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build to host online (eg. a Diablo II mod site)

Use `npm run build` (or just `vite build` to skip the TypeScript check which is kinda slow). Then deploy all the files in the `dist/` folder to wherever you'd like to host it.

Be aware that small images can be encoded inside the JS or CSS as base64 URLs. If you don't like this and would rather have all images output separately, set `assetsInlineLimit` in vite.config.ts to zero.

Take special note of [Public Base Path](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#public-base-path) configuration if your images aren't showing (cf. `base` in `vite.config.ts`).

## Build for use offline (without development environment)

Sadly we can not simply drag-and-drop the **index.html** file (from the dist/ folder) into a browser. The browser will issue [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) errors, and refuse to load both Javascript and Css files.

Follow these steps to make it work offline:

1. set `base` in vite.config.ts to `./` (a relative path) : this causes references to images and other assets to be relative eg. './images/foo.png' instead of '/images/foo.png'
2. disable code splitting to simplify next step (this is already configured so we have a single output css and js file)
3. manually edit the html to "inline" the contents of the CSS and JS

Remove these

```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index.18705ba6.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style.06ce5f32.css" />
```

And instead add script & style tags and copy the file contents inside:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <style type="text/css">
    /* copy/paste contents of the css file here */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  ...
  <script type="module">
    /* copy/paste contents of the javascript file here */
  </script>
</body>
```

# Development notes

## VSCode setup

The package **prettier** is locked at 2.2.1 because of prettier issue [10918](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/10918)

Likewise **Vetur** extension in VSCode should be locked at 0.33.1, last version to use prettier 2.2.1 (I use _Vue Language Features (Volar)_ which seems to work better with Vue3).

### Typechecking with JSDoc + TypeScript types

The project now uses JSDoc + TypeScript types via ambient `.d.ts` files. This is mainly an experiment, and also a way to make TypeScript optional. You should get correct code completions as well as TypeScript errors in the IDE with VSCode + Volar extension.

## Customizing the header

The game version as well as links in the header can be configured in the `.env` file. It can also be turned off, for eg. including in an existing layout.

## Using localStorage vs cookie

Runewizard uses **localStorage** (instead of a cookie in the old version) to maintain selected runes: this is so that the app can be built to work completely offline. In the case of loading index.html via `file:///` URL, cookies don't work.

Either way it is a known limitation that if the user clears "Cookie & other site related data" manually in their browser, the user state will be reset. For such a small app I felt it's an acceptable tradeoff, as creating a server for that seems overkill.

## Stylesheets (css, scss)

Stylesheets are kept in one folder under `src/assets/`. This is convenient for me and avoids issues with .scss linting of .vue files in VSCode not working properly (could be a bug with Vetur/Vite or maybe I misconfigured something).

In order to be able to use Sass and Tailwind together, the ordering of CSS declarations matters (cf. Tailwind imports in the main stylesheet). Ideally custom CSS should follow a strict [BEM-like syntax](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md), to avoid specificity issues.

## SVG icons

The icons come from [icones.js](https://icones.js.org/collection/fa-solid). Click "Components > Vue" in the bottom bar of that site to get the code for an icon. Could use [vite-plugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-icons) instead.
